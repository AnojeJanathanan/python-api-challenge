# python-api-challenge

In this module, I established a scropt to showcase the weather trends in more than 500 cities at different distances from the equator. To do this, I used the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API, combining them with your problem-solving abilities to create a model that represents the weather in these cities.
